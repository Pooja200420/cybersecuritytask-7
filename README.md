Browser Security Audit: Extension Management
This repository documents the process of identifying and removing suspicious browser extensions, as part of a personal security audit. The goal was to enhance browser security by managing installed extensions and understanding their potential risks.

Task Overview
The objective was to learn how to identify, evaluate, and remove potentially harmful or unnecessary browser extensions.

Steps Taken
I followed a systematic approach to review and manage my browser extensions:

Opened Browser Extension Manager: Accessed the extension/add-ons manager in my primary web browser, Google Chrome.
Reviewed All Installed Extensions: Went through the list of every installed extension, examining their names and brief descriptions.
Checked Permissions and Reviews: For each extension, I investigated the permissions it requested and, where applicable, looked for user reviews to gauge its legitimacy and common issues. Special attention was paid to overly broad permissions that didn't align with the extension's stated purpose.
Identified Unused or Suspicious Extensions: Pinpointed extensions that were no longer in use, or those that exhibited suspicious behavior, unclear functionality, or requested excessive permissions.
Removed Suspicious or Unnecessary Extensions: Actively uninstalled extensions that were deemed suspicious, potentially harmful, or simply no longer needed.
Restarted Browser: Restarted the browser to apply changes and observe any performance improvements.
Researched Malicious Extensions: Conducted research on how malicious browser extensions can harm users (e.g., data theft, ad injection, tracking, redirection, malware installation) to deepen understanding of the risks.
Documented Actions: Recorded the steps taken and listed the extensions that were removed.
Extensions Removed
During this audit, the following extensions were identified and removed from my browser:

Adobe Acrobat: PDF edit, convert, sign tools:
Reason for Removal: While from a reputable company, this extension had very broad permissions ("read and change all your data on websites you visit" and "read your Browse history") that were deemed excessive for my typical use case. I opted to use desktop PDF software or online tools on an as-needed basis to reduce the privacy footprint.
Mac Free Web ADA:
Reason for Removal: This extension was unfamiliar and its purpose was unclear upon review. Its name also raised suspicion given the context of unsolicited browser add-ons, and I decided to remove it as a precautionary measure to enhance browser security and privacy.
(Add more bullet points for any other extensions you might have removed)

Outcome and Learning
This exercise significantly increased my awareness of browser security risks and the importance of diligently managing browser extensions. Key takeaways include:

Permission Scrutiny: Always scrutinize the permissions requested by extensions, even from seemingly reputable sources. Overly broad permissions should be a red flag.
Regular Audits: Regularly reviewing installed extensions is crucial for maintaining browser hygiene and security.
"Least Privilege" Principle: Aim to grant extensions only the minimum necessary permissions for their functionality (e.g., using "on click" access where possible, if not removing entirely).
Performance Benefits: Removing unnecessary extensions can also lead to improved browser performance.
This ongoing practice will be integrated into my routine security checks to ensure a safer and more private Browse experience.
